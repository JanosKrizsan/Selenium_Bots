## Manic Clicker

How to:<br>
- Add the full path to your webdriver
- Add the site link you want your clicks on
- Add the ID of the DOM element you want clicked
- Provide your click-count

Description:<br>
It opens a new session, wait a few seconds then starts double clicking the element you provided.
A good site to try it on might be [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/), which is a fun time waster.

## General Requirements

- Python
- IDE

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)<br>

If you are using Sublime Text as your IDE, consider the Terminus package as ST itself is not interactive.

You could also create an executable from the python script using either [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/) or the [auto-py-to-exe](https://dev.to/eshleron/how-to-convert-py-to-exe-step-by-step-guide-3cfi).

## Misc.

For less hassle, I am using Sublime Text for these.
